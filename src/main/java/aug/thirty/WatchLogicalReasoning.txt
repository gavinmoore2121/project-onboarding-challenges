A watch, which loses time uniformly, was observed to be 5 minutes fast at 8.00 p.m. on Thursday. It was noticed to be 7
 minutes slow at 8.00 a.m. on the subsequent Monday. When did the watch show the correct time ? Explanation needed.

a) 7 a.m. Saturday b) 7 a.m. on Friday

c) 10a.m. on Sunday d) 11 a.m. on Friday

Solution: B.

Total hours: 84 hours
Total minutes slower than actual time: 12 minutes
Hours for watch to slow down by 1 minute: 84 hours / 12 min slowed = 7 hours/min slowed.
Hours until correct time from Thursday: 5 minutes slowed * 7 hours/min slowed = 35 hours until correct time.
Correct time = 20:00 Thursday + 35 hours = 20:00 Friday + 11 hours = 07:00 Friday.
Correct time = 7 a.m. on Friday, B.
